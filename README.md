## Example Voting App Kubernetes

This is based on the original [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) repository from the [docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples) GitHub page

and modified it to work on the Kubernetes cluster.

This GitHub repository contains the deployment configurations for a Kubernetes-based voting application. The application is designed to showcase the capabilities of Kubernetes for managing containerized applications in a distributed environment.

Inside this repository, you'll find Kubernetes manifests for deploying the various components of the voting application, including the frontend, backend, and database. These manifests are written in YAML and are structured to leverage Kubernetes features such as pods, services, deployments, and persistent volumes.

Feel free to explore the configurations, make improvements, or adapt them for your own projects. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!
